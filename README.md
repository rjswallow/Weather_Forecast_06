# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

In this project we use API's to pull and display information without having to code the information. The data is requested, recieved, and then must be parsed so that only the desired information is displayed.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for the API code that will retrieve weather data for cities. 

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Usage

```
To use the Weather Dashboard enter the name of the city you are interested in. The current weather will display in the top window. The 5 day forcast will display in the cards below the top window. 

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:rjswallow/Weather_Forecast_06.git
```
